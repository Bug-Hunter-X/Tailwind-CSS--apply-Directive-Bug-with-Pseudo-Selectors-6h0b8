This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive will apply the styles for the base class, but not the pseudo-selector styles. This can lead to unexpected behavior and a mismatch between the design and the actual output. For example:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

```css
/* Tailwind directives */
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
    @apply hover:bg-blue-700;  /* This doesn't work as expected */
  }
}
```

The hover effect (`hover:bg-blue-700`) will not be applied because the `@apply` directive does not correctly handle pseudo-selectors in this context.
