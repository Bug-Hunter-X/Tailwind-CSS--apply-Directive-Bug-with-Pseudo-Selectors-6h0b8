The correct approach is to apply the pseudo-selector classes directly in your HTML, rather than through the `@apply` directive. This ensures that Tailwind CSS properly handles the styles for the different states.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

Alternatively, you can create separate classes for the base and hover states and apply them individually:

```css
/* Tailwind directives */
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
  .btn-primary-hover {
    @apply bg-blue-700;
  }
}
```

```html
<button class="btn-primary hover:btn-primary-hover">
  Hover Me
</button>
```
This method offers better separation of concerns and improves maintainability.
